- Use strict null checks to prevent null and undefined errors
- Prefer types over interfaces for defining object shapes
- Use type guards and assertions for runtime type checking
- Implement proper type inference to reduce unnecessary type annotations
- Look for already defined types in `src/types` before defining new ones
