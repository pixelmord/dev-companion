# Affinity Mapping

Recommended for: Established teams; Large backlogs; Early-stage estimation

Teams of: Small Teams

Items of: Small Items

Description:

Instead of asking the team to set an estimate outright, affinity estimation is all about comparisons. Affinity estimation lowers the cognitive load and helps teams process more user stories, faster.

The product owner takes the first item and asks the team to set an estimate for it, using any scale as a base. Let’s say, for example, that the team has agreed a story is an 8 on their scale.

Items are then grouped by similarity. When you read out the next story, the task is simply to compare it. Is that story larger or smaller than the 8 we’ve already identified?

If your team members have differing views on a particular story, have an open discussion about it.

Once this exercise has been carried out for all your stories, you can decide on the next steps. Perhaps all the items smaller are good to go already and you want to focus on estimating the larger ones in more detail.
