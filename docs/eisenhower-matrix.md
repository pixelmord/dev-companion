# Eisenhower Matrix

The "planning quadrant" or Eisenhower Matrix helps prioritize tasks by categorizing them into four quadrants based on urgency and importance: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and neither urgent nor important.
Here's a breakdown of each quadrant:
Quadrant 1: Urgent and Important (Do):
These tasks require immediate attention and have significant consequences if not addressed promptly, such as crises, project deadlines, and critical issues.
Quadrant 2: Important but Not Urgent (Schedule):
These tasks contribute to long-term goals, planning, and preparation, but don't demand immediate action, such as relationship building, skill enhancement, and strategic planning.
Quadrant 3: Urgent but Not Important (Delegate):
These tasks seem urgent but don't contribute significantly to your goals, such as interruptions, emails, and some meetings.
Quadrant 4: Neither Urgent nor Important (Delete):
These tasks are distractions and time-wasters that should be minimized or eliminated, such as excessive social media use or trivial matters.
How to use the Eisenhower Matrix:

1. List all your tasks:
Identify all the tasks you need to complete.
2. Categorize into quadrants:
Place each task into one of the four quadrants based on its urgency and importance.
3. Prioritize:
Focus on tasks in Quadrant 1 (Urgent and Important) first, then move to Quadrant 2 (Important but Not Urgent).
4. Delegate or eliminate:
Delegate tasks in Quadrant 3 (Urgent but Not Important) and minimize or eliminate tasks in Quadrant 4 (Neither Urgent nor Important).
