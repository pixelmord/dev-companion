# 5 Good Estimation Techniques

Every software development team can benefit from understanding a range of techniques.

While it's true that software estimation methods have some inherent flaws and pitfalls due to the limitations of human experience and intuition, a combination of techniques can help mitigate estimation risks. It increases the chance your teams will make informed decisions, manage risks, and deliver projects on time and within budget.

Teams should review the product backlog in whatever project management tools you use, whether that be Jira, Asana, Linear or something else, and have a thoughtful and routine effort estimation process.

You’ll notice that there are pitfalls in every estimation technique. My view is that AI will soon be ready to help estimate far better. Understanding different ways of estimating will help us to be critical in how we think about AI-assisted estimation. More on that later.

1. Planning Poker
Planning Poker is a consensus-based estimation technique.

During a Planning Poker session, team members estimate the effort required for each task using a deck of cards with numerical values. The team then discusses their estimates and tries to come to a consensus for a story point estimate. This process continues until all the tasks are estimated.

It promotes collaboration, tries to avoid anchoring bias, and ensures that every team member's opinion is heard.

Planning Poker is a great technique, but it can take a while, especially if you have a big team or a complex project.

Good for: small to medium-sized teams, small- to medium-sized projects, and projects with uncertainty about scope or complexity.

2. Three-Point Method
The Three-Point Method is used to estimate the time required to complete a project by considering the best-case, worst-case, and most-likely scenarios.

These estimates are usually represented using three values: optimistic, pessimistic, and realistic. The average of the three values is then used to calculate the overall estimation.

The Three-Point Method is particularly useful when dealing with uncertain tasks or projects. It helps teams to account for the best and worst-case scenarios and consider the likelihood of each scenario.

One problem with the Three-Point Method is that it sometimes doesn't yield accurate estimates for uncertain tasks or projects. It's important to ensure that the team has enough information about the task or project before starting the estimation process.

Good for: Large teams (though works at any size), complex and uncertain projects.

3. PERT Estimation
The Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) is a statistical estimation technique used to estimate the time required to complete a project by considering the expected duration of each task and the dependencies between them.

Team members identify the tasks required to complete the project and estimate the expected duration for each task. The team members then identify the dependencies between the tasks and create a network diagram. The expected duration of the project is then calculated using a weighted average of the expected duration of each task.

PERT estimation is particularly useful for large and complex projects.

It helps teams to account for the dependencies and has the potential to provide a more accurate estimation of the overall project duration.

But it can be time-consuming and requires a lot of information about the project.

Good for: Large teams (though works at any size), complex and uncertain projects, and projects requiring risk management.

4. Analogous Estimation
This method estimates the effort required to complete a project by comparing it to similar past projects.

Start by identifying similar past projects and estimate the effort required to complete the current project based on the effort required for the past projects. This process is particularly useful when dealing with similar projects or tasks.

Analogous estimation should be a quick and easy technique to use as it relies on past project data. It helps teams to save time and resources by avoiding the need to estimate each task or project from scratch.

You need to watch out for false positives – some similar-looking tickets may not be so simple under the hood. Diving deeper into requirements can help.

Good for: Any situation where historical data is available and easy to access and analyse, unless you have AI help. You'll need strong codebase knowledge (or AI) in your team to capitalise on this method.

5. Large Small Uncertain (LSU)
LSU categorises tasks based on their size and uncertainty. Identify the tasks required to complete the project and categorise them as large, small, or uncertain.

The effort required for each category is then estimated, and the total effort for the project is calculated.

The LSU Method is particularly useful when dealing with projects that involve a mix of small and large tasks with varying degrees of uncertainty. It helps teams to account for the size and uncertainty of each task and provides a more accurate estimation of the overall effort required for the project.

One potential problem with the LSU Method is that it may be difficult to categorise tasks accurately, especially if the team members have different opinions on what constitutes a large, small, or uncertain task. It's important to ensure that the team has a shared understanding of the task categorisation before starting the estimation process.

Good for: Teams with strong codebase knowledge. Projects with uncertainty and risk.
